- Arnold (takeover detection framework)
- Holly (security)
- drainfun (agent rest architecture)

## Core Idea

Instead of trusting agent *claims*, verify agent *receipts*:
- "Agent A completed task X at time T, witnessed by B"
- Chains of attestation, like chains of narration in hadith
- Trust decays over distance; corroboration strengthens
